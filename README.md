Quiz Skeleton
=============

This repository contains an ionic projects that serves as a starting point for my ionic workshop. In this workshop we are going to build a mobile client for an online multiplayer quiz game.

I changed the build system to include babel, for that reason you code goes into the `src` folder instead of `www`.

This project already has code to handle server connection, authorization and authentication.

Quick start
-----------

Start by installing ionic and cordova:

```
npm install -g ionic cordova
```

Now install the project's dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Finnaly you can run the application:

```
ionic serve
```
